"I would give her it, but she might not think it is a good rock."
"She was so far away that we had to call for her three times."
"Why did you look behind you like that?"
"She has such wild energy that it is hard to calm her down."
"Does the color look blue to you, or is it actually white?"
"That would not be the first time, but I hope it is the last."
"She wanted him to find a rock as small as hers."
"Maybe if you hadn't found them, they would have moved."
"You must have heard those children climbing!"
"Don't tell me that you didn't look for a black leaf."
"Who else could have planned for such a day?"
"The first child will be ahead of the second by only a little."
"They jumped here and there without ever finding it."
"Digging was very hard, hence the low energy."
"She would otherwise be an only child."
"He would have seen the tree if he had been bigger."
"Maybe the fruit on the ground is good, but probably not."
"I was ahead of you years ago, but not anymore."
"I will find one sibling if they will find the other."
"I couldn't call you at such a time!"
"Where did they jump while you were looking at the stars?"
"Don't move the yellow leaves until the year is over."
"We didn't plan to hear it, but we still did."
"When I look at you, I see a good parent."
"At this time of day, no one else is home."
"They have heard neither the white star nor the red star."
"How many of those leaves are yellow?"
"By this time tomorrow, she will have climbed three trees."
"She is closer than him to the wild fruit, but he can't see that."
