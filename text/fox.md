# Fox

This is the story of a fox. This fox loves to run. She loves running after other animals and even insects. She runs really fast. She loves to feel the wind as she runs. She loves going to different places. She loves meeting other animals. She loves making new friends.

One day, she received an invitation. She got a beautiful, purple envelope. On one side is the word "Come!" Inside was a purple paper with lots of flourish. Someone is celebrating a birthday! She took the paper out, and read aloud: "I am inviting you to my birthday!" Below, it says, "Love, the bear".

"The bear invited me!" the fox said to herself. She can't believe it! This bear is very popular. She has such cool fur! She is a good singer. She also likes to travel to far places. Purple is her favorite color. The fox has been to some of the bear's parties and they are the best! She jumped on the grass. She is very excited.

First she thought about the gift that she will give to the bear. Now, that is hard to think of. The bear already has everything she needs. The fox thought hard but she couldn't think of anything. So, she went outside to ask for the other animals' opinion.

She climbed the high mountain and found the deer. The fox asked her, "What gift should I give the bear?"

"You should give her some fresh fruit. A bear would love to have fresh fruit!" The deer suggested.

"A piece of fruit sounds good but I'll need to find the perfect one," the fox thought.

Then, she bent her head down low. She saw the ant. She was carrying some pebbles and she laid them on the ground.

"What gift should I give the bear?" The fox asked.

"You should giver her gems like this here piece of gold!" the ant replied.

"That's really nice, but where will she put it for safe keeping?" The fox thought.

The fox walked on and found the wolf. She was hard to miss because she always exploring the land.

"What gift should I give the bear?" The fox asked.

"Oh, you should give her a nice stick to chew!" The wolf answered.

"But I'm not sure if the bear likes to chew sticks," The fox thought.

She walked on and found the worm. She had to look hard because the worm was so small and burried in the mud.

"What gift should I give the bear?" The fox asked.

"Oh, how I wish somebody would give me a gift! I would wish for a rich plot of land!" The worm answered.

"Well that is everywhere, but what kind of land would she like?" The fox thought.

She continued walking and she asked other animals too. She asked the beaver, the squirrel, the goose, the owl, and the rabbit. They all made suggestions but not one of them sounded right.

After a few minutes, she reached a patch of flowers under a tree. If there's one thing she knows about the bear, it's that she loves the color purple. That's when she had a bright idea.

"I know! I will give her fresh purple flowers! I will make a purple pot from the clay, too." The fox thought.

She went home happily, knowing that the bear will love her gift. She finally felt calm knowing that she has taken care of everything that she needs for the party.

On the day of the bear's party, the fox carried a purple pot full of purple flowers that she picked along the way.

She was amazed when she saw the bear's house. There was purple everywhere saying, "You are in the right place!", with a big purple cake with lots of beautiful purple decorations close to the entry way.

A leaf fell as the fox entered the house. It all looks beautiful! She almost stepped on a rock. Fortunately, the bear showed up and warned her right before she stepped on it.

"Welcome to my party!" the bear said.

"Thank you! Here's my gift. Happy Birthday!" The fox replied.

"Wow! These flowers are beautiful! The pot is wonderful too!" The bear said.

"Thank you! I'm glad that you liked my gift. I was worried because I didn't know what gift you would like. You seem to have everything you want," The fox replied honestly.

"Oh, I think you picked the perfect gift. I love flowers and I love the color purple. But what really makes me happy is that you came to my party. More than your gift, it's your friendship that I love most!" The bear said.
