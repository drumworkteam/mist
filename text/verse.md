# Verse

These are the parts your mouth and tongue shape.<br/>
Sharing yourself in new ways to the lake.<br/>
These are the symbols representing sound bits.<br/>
Combining into a rhythm like the drum hits.<br/>
Soon you'll notice that each twist and turn fits.<br/>

These are the wholes that link the speech tones
Morphing our intelligence as we play with each Stone.<br/>
These are the words we separate with spaces.<br/>
Defining them carefully so we get down to the basics.<br/>
You'll soon learn how to use them in statements.<br/>

These are the threads that frame what you speak.<br/>
Giving others a peek at your inner geek.<br/>
These are the sentences your voice brings in the night.<br/>
Manifesting the invisible in the mindâ€™s eye.<br/>
Now you're a chat master, next is an invite.<br/>

These are the structures that make the light whiter.<br/>
Making it possible to communicate about the higher.<br/>
These are the trees in which we mold information.<br/>
Seeing ourselves and the universe as one big computation.<br/>
The key thing to remember is patterns and patience.<br/>

These are the networks merging everything into one.<br/>
Connecting knowledge together like the moon and the sun.<br/>
These are the primary thing the Earth yields.<br/>
Filling the memory with energy from Brook and Field.<br/>
If you've made it this far it's the Stone that you wield.
